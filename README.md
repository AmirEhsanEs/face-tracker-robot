# face-tracker-robot
Face-Tracker-Robot is an innovative project designed to track and follow faces using a combination of Arduino, PyQt5, and Mediapipe. The robot uses real-time face detection to control its movements and track a person within its environment. The project integrates machine learning models with a robotic system for dynamic interaction
