# face-tracker-robot
Face-Tracker-Robot is an innovative project designed to track and follow faces using a combination of Arduino, PyQt5, and Mediapipe. The robot uses real-time face detection to control its movements and track a person within its environment. The project integrates machine learning models with a robotic system for dynamic interaction 
Technologies Used
Arduino: For controlling motors and actuators to move the robot.
PyQt5: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to interact with the robot and monitor its status.
Mediapipe: A framework by Google for real-time computer vision tasks, used here for detecting and tracking faces in video streams.
OpenCV: For handling video streams and processing the data to track face positions.
Serial Communication: Used to send face position data from the computer to the Arduino.
